					<h2><a id="about">About Us</a></h2>
					<p>Due to the fact that a lot of Nigerians have had fair to bad experiences in the peer to peer donation industry, We at i-revolution have done our due dilligence on the most common challenges of Peer2Peer payment system. At i-revolution, we ensure that EVERY member gets paid. Our system does not move forward if a member does not get paid. This ensures that everyone gets what they are promised. We promise you 100% of your money in 1 - 7 days, we guarantee that you get your money in that time too. Our peer to peer donation system is a community and as such the community can only move forward when all members adhere to the rule of the game, all community members are treated as kings. Your kingdom means you will always have what you are entitled to! You have a kingdom with us as a member, we help you preserve and protect your capital. We ensure that everyone gets back what they are entitled to. Everyone gets paid!</p>
